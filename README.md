I created a program that processes the necessary well data to determine the optimal bottom hole pressure and flow rate for efficient well operation. The program calculates the operational point using a linear Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) model and the Poettmannâ€“Carpenter's Tubing Performance Relationship (TPR) model. These models work together to predict the conditions under which the well should operate to achieve the desired balance between inflow and outflow, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.
